# devflow-cli LinkedIn Post — Claude Opus 4.5 Final Version

## 🏆 THE POST

```
I mass forgot the conventional commit format mid-commit yesterday.

Again.

Stood there staring at my terminal trying to remember:

Is it feat(scope): message
Or feat[scope]: message  
Or feat: (scope) message

I mass been doing this for 9 years.

And I still blank on it at least once a week.

Not because I'm dumb. Because my brain prioritizes solving the actual problem over memorizing syntax that I use intermittently.

This is the dirty truth nobody talks about:

We all have things we "should" know by now but don't.
We all Google the same commands repeatedly.
We all feel slightly embarrassed about it.

So I stopped fighting my brain.

I built a CLI that holds the patterns so I don't have to.

When I create a branch now:
→ "What type?" I pick: feat
→ "Ticket?" I type: PROJ-123  
→ "Description?" I type: add login

It creates: feat/PROJ-123_add-login

When I commit:
→ "Type?" I pick: fix
→ "Scope?" I pick: auth
→ "Message?" I type: handle expired tokens

It writes: fix(auth): handle expired tokens

I don't remember the format.
I don't need to.
The tool remembers.

6 months later:
- Zero malformed commits
- Zero "what's our branch convention again?" Slack messages
- Zero mid-commit Googling
- Zero cognitive drain on syntax

My brain now has that RAM back for actual engineering.

The tool is called devflow. It's free. It's open source. Link in comments.

Stop memorizing patterns your brain doesn't want to hold.

What's the one thing you keep re-learning but never retain?

## Why This Version Wins

**The Hook:**
"I mass forgot the conventional commit format mid-commit yesterday."

- Immediate relatability (we've ALL done this)
- Vulnerability (admitting you forgot something "basic")
- Specific moment (yesterday, mid-commit) — feels real, not hypothetical

**The Insight:**
"My brain prioritizes solving the actual problem over memorizing syntax I use intermittently."

- Reframes "forgetting" as intelligent prioritization
- Removes shame — it's not you, it's how brains work
- Makes the reader feel smart, not dumb

**The Dirty Truth:**
"We all have things we 'should' know by now but don't."

- Creates solidarity
- Breaks the pretense that senior devs remember everything
- Permission to admit the shared secret

**The Solution:**
"I stopped fighting my brain."

- Not "I built a tool" — that's boring
- "I stopped fighting" — that's relief
- Positions the tool as acceptance, not compensation

**The Proof:**
Specific before/after with exact commands, not vague benefits.

**The Payoff:**
"My brain now has that RAM back for actual engineering."

- Technical metaphor devs love
- Reframes productivity as freed mental resources
- Makes it about better work, not laziness

**The CTA:**
"What's the one thing you keep re-learning but never retain?"

- Universal, easy to answer
- Creates engagement without being pushy
- Generates stories in comments (social proof)
